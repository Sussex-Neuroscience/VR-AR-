# VR-AR-goggles

Hello!

Welcome to the documentation for the VR/AR goggles. These is just a reproduction of the google cardboard project. Here we document how to build them using 3D designs that are available online and buying off-the-shelf components. 

This goggles are going to be used for outreach and education events organized by the Neuroscience department at the University of Sussex.
