# printed goggles

This is the printed frame used to hold the phone at the correct distance from the lenses and the user's eyes. There are several models available online, either as printable models, or as parts that can be bought on eBay/Amazon. we used this specific model because it is unibody, so it is easy to print (print it in one go), and there is no messing around with putting parts together etc. Should follow Google cardboard goggles specs (https://support.google.com/cardboard/manufacturers/answer/6323398?hl=en)
